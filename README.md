# trom_sinatra_business

This is a mock business website that sells Python Pranks.  Built with Ruby and Sinatra NOT Python.

Sinatra routing enabled, but also sendgrid functionality.

You can visit this site below 

https://python-prank-emporium.herokuapp.com/

NB: I was looney from lack of sleep; this is not a real site.

Obviously most of the pranks involve multiple felonies and stealing exotic snakes combined with breaking and entering.

With that being said, if you know a Python tip or prank you want me to add let me know :)
